* organize words by anagram

Given a word list, sort all the words so that each line, in
alphabetical order, is a sorted alphabetical list of all the anagrams
of the word.  No word should occur on more than one line, because all
the words that are anagrams of other words are on one line.

** Example

   consider a very short word list:

   act
   arm
   cat
   ram
   horse
   shore
   tac

   The resulting output should be:

   act cat tac
   arm ram
   horse shore
