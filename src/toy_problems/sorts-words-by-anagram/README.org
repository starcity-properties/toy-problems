* organize words by anagram

Given a word list, sort all the words so that each line, in
alphabetical order, is a sorted alphabetical list of all the anagrams
of the word.  No word should occur on more than one line, because all
the words that are anagrams of other words are on one line.

** Example

   consider a very short word list:

   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     act
     arm
     cat
     ram
     horse
     shore
     tac
   #+END_SRC

   The resulting output should be:

   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     act cat tac
     arm ram
     horse shore
   #+END_SRC
