# Common Characters

Write a function that two strings as arguments and returns a string containing the characters found in both strings (without duplication), in the order that they appeared in the first string. Remember to skip spaces and characters you have already encountered!

## Example Usage
```clojure
(common-characters "acexivou" "aegihobu") ;;=> 'aeiou'
```


## Advanced Content
Extend your function to handle more than two input strings!


## Problem Solving Process
Use these steps below to aid you in using the problem solving process.

#### Specification (define the rules to the problem)


#### Justificaiton (why would I call this function?)


#### Explanation (how does the input to the function relate to the output?)


#### Visualization (draw a plan that another engineer could understand and implement)


#### Approximation (translate your drawing of a plan into pseudocode)


#### Verification (use sample inputs and "be the machine" - interpreting your plan like code)


#### Implementation (translate your pseudocode into beautiful, simple clojure!)
