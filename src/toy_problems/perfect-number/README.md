# Perfect Number


## Contextual Information
A [*perfect number*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.

The first perfect number is `6`, as `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. The next three perfect numbers are 28, 496, and 8128.

## Your Goal
Write a function that accepts a *number* and returns a *boolean*, indicating whether or not that number is a perfect number.

## Example Usage
```clojure
(perfect-number? 6) ;;=> true
(perfect-number? 7) ;;=> false
(perfect-number? 28) ;;=> true
```

## Problem Solving Process
Use these steps below to aid you in using the problem solving process.

#### Specification (define the rules to the problem)


#### Justificaiton (why would I call this function?)


#### Explanation (how does the input to the function relate to the output?)


#### Visualization (draw a plan that another engineer could understand and implement)


#### Approximation (translate your drawing of a plan into pseudocode)


#### Verification (use sample inputs and "be the machine" - interpreting your plan like code)


#### Implementation (translate your pseudocode into beautiful, simple clojure!)
