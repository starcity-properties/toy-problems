# Overlapping Rectangles


You're given a string of four coordinate pairs, indicating the opposite corner of two rectangles. (The first two pairs belong to one rectangle, the last two pairs belong to a different rectangle).

Write a function that returns the area of overlap (*length \* width*) between the two rectangles. If there is no overlap at all, return `-1`.
