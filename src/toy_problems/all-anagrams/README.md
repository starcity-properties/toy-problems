# All Anagrams


An [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) is a word that can be made by rearranging all of the letters from another word. For example: **"silent"** is an anagram of **"listen"** (and _vice-versa_).

Write a function that takes a string and returns every possible anagram of that string. You may assume that the input string will only contain lowercase letters from a-z, with no numbers, spaces, or special characters. For the purpose of this exercise, the anagrams generated by your function do not need to be actual English words.


## Example Usage:

```clojure
(all-anagrams "eat") ;;=> ["ate aet eat eta tae tea"]
(all-anagrams "bob") ;;=> ["bob" "bbo" "obb"]
(all-anagrams "dog") ;;=> ["dog" "dgo" "odg" "ogd" "gdo" "god"]
```
