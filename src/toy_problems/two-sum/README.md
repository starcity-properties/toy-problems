# two-sum


Write a function that, when given a *vector of integers* and a *target integer*, returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the sum of any two numbers in the *vector* equals the *target integer.**


**Advanced Content:** Rather than returning a boolean, return a list of pairs of numbers found in the vector whose sum equals the target.
